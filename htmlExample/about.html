    <p>
        I need to tell everyone about Neocities.
        Neocities is a recreation of Geocities, 
        a webpage creation site that allows for maximum creativity.
        Geocities was nuked in 1999 after its aquisition by Yahoo, unfortunately.

        But now Neocities provides a place for FREE, advertisement FREE to create custom webpages.
        There is a bustling community of coders, blinkie, blingee, and other Web 2.0 art creators and resource hoarders.
        Check it out and create something! It's really cool!
    </p>
